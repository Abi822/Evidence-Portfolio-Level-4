                Please remember that your lecturers teach several classes, and also require preparation time in their offices for planning
                classes, marking and other work. If you wish to talk to a lecturer outside of class time, please politely
                contact your lecturer and ask for an appointment. The most effective way of doing this is to email your lecturers
                or leave a message on their voicemail.
